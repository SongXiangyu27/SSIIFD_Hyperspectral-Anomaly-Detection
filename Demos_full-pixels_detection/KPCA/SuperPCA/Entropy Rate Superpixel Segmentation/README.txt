Thanks for your interest in our work. This is a MATLAB wrapper for the
Entropy Rate Superpixel Segmentation algorithm. For more detail about 
the algorithm please refer to the project webpage

* 			Installation and usage									*
/********************************************************************

1) Unzipped the files to $HOME_DIR   

2) We have provided pre-compiled mex functions. You may not need to 
recompile the mex files again. If you need to recompile the codes. 
In the matlab command prompt, type >>make. This should do the job.

3) Type demo to see a demonstration of the usage of the code.

mex_ers.mex : compute the superpixel segmentation for an input image.
usage:
	[labels] = mex_ers(image,nC);
	[labels] = mex_ers(image,nC,lambda,sigma);
Input: 
	image  : the input grey scale image
	nC     : the number of desired superpixels
	lambda : the balancing parameter ( default = 0.5; )
	sigma  : the kernel bandwidth  ( default = 5.0; )
Output: 
	labels : the output image. Each pixel is labeled with the label 
	         of the superpixel it belongs to. Note that the labeling
			 begins from 0 to nC-1
